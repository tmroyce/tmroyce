# 👋 Hi, I'm Michael Royce Tan

I'm Michael, I'm a nurse - seven years, mostly cardiac units. I started getting curious about bigger patterns in patient outcomes, so I went back to school for my MPH at Michigan. I got some clinical research experience at Inovio Pharmaceuticals, and I've been learning R and SAS. I'm hoping to find opportunities in clinical research. Still learning a lot, but I'm really interested in this work.


## 🔬 My Journey

Years ago, I became a nurse because I wanted to contribute to patient care. Today, I'm passionate about contributing to patient care at a much larger scale—through clinical research and health data analytics that transform individual observations into insights that can help patients.

> _What guides me is a love of learning paired with a need for meaning. I'm energized by complexity—but I always ask, how does this connect to people, purpose, and the greater good?_

After years in direct patient care, I found myself constantly asking research questions that went beyond individual patient encounters:

- Why do certain populations have higher readmission rates?
- What patterns exist in our treatment outcomes?
- How can we use data to prevent problems before they start?

These questions led me to pursue my MPH at University of Michigan, where I've discovered that my work is most fulfilling when I can bring structure to chaos—transforming complex clinical observations into analytical findings that drive meaningful change.


## 🎯 What Drives Me
I'm excited about opportunities where clinical research meets real patient lives, and where every analytical decision matters for the people who will ultimately benefit from the treatments we're developing.

> _I believe the best research doesn't just generate data—it generates insights that genuinely improve patient outcomes._
