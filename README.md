# 👋 Hi, I'm Michael Royce Tan

I'm a nurse with seven years of clinical experience who became curious about population-level patterns in patient outcomes. I strategically developed research skills through my MPH at Michigan, gained some pharmaceutical industry exposure at Inovio, and now I'm ready to contribute to clinical research where I can bridge clinical insight with analytical capabilities.


## 🔬 My Journey

Years ago, I became a nurse because I wanted to contribute to patient care. Today, I'm passionate about contributing to patient care at a much larger scale—through clinical research and health data analytics that transform individual observations into insights that can help patients.

> _What guides me is a love of learning paired with a need for meaning. I'm energized by complexity—but I always ask, how does this connect to people, purpose, and the greater good?_

After years in direct patient care, I found myself constantly asking research questions that went beyond individual patient encounters:

- Why do certain populations have higher readmission rates?
- What patterns exist in our treatment outcomes?
- How can we use data to prevent problems before they start?

These questions led me to pursue my MPH at University of Michigan, where I've discovered that my work is most fulfilling when I can bring structure to chaos—transforming complex clinical observations into analytical findings that drive meaningful change.


## 🎯 What Drives Me
I'm excited about opportunities where clinical research meets real patient lives, and where every analytical decision matters for the people who will ultimately benefit from the treatments we're developing.

> _I believe the best research doesn't just generate data—it generates insights that genuinely improve patient outcomes._
